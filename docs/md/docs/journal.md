The town council told us to investigate a master builder(?) who went missing. He was found dead in the inn.

[Megolas](/docs/party#megolas) and [Llywd](/docs/party#llwyd-urswick) went to go tell the town council. A vandal climbed the walls outside and entered the room, but was not apprehended. Met [Alyssa](/docs/npcs#alyssa) and she casted speak with the dead on the dead master builder. We were lead to a warehouse.
