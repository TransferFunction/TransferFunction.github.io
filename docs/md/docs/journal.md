The town council told us to investigate a master builder(?) who went missing. He was found dead in the inn. [Beef](/docs/party#beef) and [Dew](/docs/party#bwoop-bwoop-\(dew\)) stayed behind to guard the body. [Megolas](/docs/party#megolas) and [Llywd](/docs/party#llwyd-urswick) went to go tell the town council. A vandal climbed the walls outside and entered the room, but was not apprehended. Met [Alyssa](/docs/npcs#alyssa) and she casted speak with the dead on the dead master builder. We were lead to a warehouse. [Mungo](/docs/party#mungo-freefoot-cotton) played "Wonderwall for 8 hours straight".
