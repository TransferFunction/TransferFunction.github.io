## Vermintide Dungeon
We went under the city of [Waybridge](#Waybridge) down a shaft in the bell/shipping warehouse. Navigated a tunnel full or shriekers and poisonous shrooms. We were chased by the vermin tide. We fought a dude that rang a bell that caused fear. He jumped into a puddle of green and transformed. We destroyed the bell that had a heart of the dungeon.
